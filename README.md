# Tongue Twister Scraper and Diction Trainer

This repository contains two Go applications:

1.  **Tongue Twister Scraper**: A tool to scrape tongue twisters from a website.
2.  **Diction Trainer**: An interactive command-line tool to practice diction using the scraped tongue twisters.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed on your system (version 1.16 or higher is recommended).

## 1. Tongue Twister Scraper

This application scrapes tongue twisters and saves them as individual text files and a single JSON file.

### Build

To build the scraper executable, navigate to the project root directory and run:

```bash
go build -o scrapeSite main.go
```

### Run

Run the scraper from the project root directory. The scraped data will be saved in the `tongue_twisters` directory by default.

```bash
./scrapeSite [flags]
```

**Flags:**

*   `-concurrency <number>`: Number of concurrent workers (default: number of CPU cores). Example: `./scrapeSite -concurrency 4`
*   `-output <directory>`: Directory to save output files (default: `tongue_twisters`). Example: `./scrapeSite -output my_twisters`

**Example Usage:**

```bash
./scrapeSite -concurrency 8 -output scraped_data
```

## 2. Diction Trainer

This interactive command-line application helps you practice diction using the JSON file generated by the scraper.

### Build

To build the trainer executable, navigate to the `cmd/easy_trainer` directory and run:

```bash
go build -o easy_trainer main.go
```

### Run

Run the trainer from the `cmd/easy_trainer` directory. By default, it looks for the `all_twisters.json` file in `../tongue_twisters/`.

```bash
./easy_trainer [flags]
```

**Flags:**

*   `-json <path>`: Path to JSON file with tongue twisters (default: `tongue_twisters/all_twisters.json`).
*   `-count <number>`: How many random tongue twisters to select for training (default: 5).
*   `-difficulty <level>`: Difficulty level (easy, medium, hard, expert, all) (default: `all`).
*   `-mode <mode>`: Training mode (standard, timed, repeat, challenge, perfection) (default: `standard`).
*   `-time <seconds>`: Seconds per tongue twister in timed mode (default: 30).
*   `-reps <number>`: Number of repetitions in repeat mode (default: 3).
*   `-focus <number>`: Focus area for perfection mode (0-4, see documentation in `cmd/easy_trainer/main.go` for details) (default: 0).
*   `-level <number>`: Perfection level (1-5, higher is more demanding) (default: 3).
*   `-mix <boolean>`: Mix different difficulty levels when selecting twisters (default: true).

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Run standard training with 10 medium difficulty twisters
./easy_trainer -count 10 -difficulty medium

# Run timed training with 5 random twisters, 20 seconds per twister
./easy_trainer -mode timed -time 20

# Run perfection mode focusing on rhythm with a higher perfection level
./easy_trainer -mode perfection -focus 1 -level 4
```
